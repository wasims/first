<div id="subheading">Hi there,</div>
<div class="maincontent">
  <p>My name is Wasim, you're visiting this page as a result of exchanging contact details or meeting me in person. We might have briefly talked about you wanting to set up a small website.</p>
  <p>I only set up websites and accept clients that do not currently have any type of web hosting. There are a few reasons for this. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I do not charge huge fees to design your website. </li>
    <li>I have one simple available package and that is only £5.99 a month for your web space and a domain name that will cost around £18 a year.</li>
    <li>Things have become a lot more difficult because of the lockdowns and I understand that we have become  more reluctant or even a little scared to spend, therefore I think it is important to keep expenditure low, atleast in the early stages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My main aim is to set up a simple little website that does not require constant maintenance, but does the job for you to provide the required details for your customers or clients.</p>
